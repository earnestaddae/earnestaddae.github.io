# Frikanda - Crowdfund | Pathfind | Essays

`Frikanda` is a different approach to assisting cancer patients via crowdfunding, personalized services and inspiring essays.

We strongly believe that nobody can tell their story best than the person who has first hand experience of what it feels to be diagnosed of cancer.

Living with cancer is physically, emotionally, spiritually, and financially exhausting. Therefore, with such a platform like Frikanda, cancer patients can ease their burden via fundraisers, blogging and personalized services.

Frikanda is GoFundMe meets Substack, except for cancer patients. We are solving a problem that is obvious to everyone, but with a different pair of eyes.
